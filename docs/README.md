## Quick Start

EvoSec is a cybersecurity research lab environment designed for experimentation, analysis, and demonstration. It combines honeypots, intrusion detection/prevention systems, automated orchestration, monitoring, and secure network segmentation to enable safe, repeatable, and realistic security testing.

See [01‑Architecture](01-Architecture.md) for an overview of the system architecture.
