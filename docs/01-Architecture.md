## Overview

EvoSec is a comprehensive lab environment for cybersecurity research and operational analysis. It supports multi-VM experiments, containerized services, and hypervisor snapshots — enabling flexible, reproducible, realistic testing environments.  

The platform integrates honeypots, tar pits, IDS/IPS systems, and provides dynamic network orchestration (VLAN reconfiguration), automated failure containment, and threat simulation.
